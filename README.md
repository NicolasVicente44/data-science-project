This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features extracted from a dataset. The model utilizes linear regression to analyze the impact of different characteristics, such as the car's year, condition, odometer reading, and manufacturer, on its selling price.

Features
Data Cleaning: The project includes extensive data cleaning processes, including handling missing values, optimizing data types, and filtering out incomplete observations.

Feature Selection: The model focuses on relevant features to improve prediction accuracy, ensuring that only complete data is used for training and testing.

Linear Regression Model: A linear regression model is implemented using Scikit-learn, allowing for straightforward analysis and interpretation of the model's performance.

Performance Evaluation: The model's effectiveness is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score, providing insights into its predictive accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various attributes of cars, including:

year: The manufacturing year of the car.
make: The manufacturer of the car.
model: The specific model of the car.
condition: A numeric representation of the car's condition.
odometer: The mileage of the car.
mmr: The market value reference for the car.
sellingprice: The price at which the car is sold.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
